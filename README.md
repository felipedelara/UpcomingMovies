# UpcomingMovies

iOS project consuming the movie API from https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/

JSON scheme was converted to Swift classes using quicktype (with added adjustments).

TODO:
- Detail view with added information about the movies
- Implementing movie genres - probably though another API call
- Figure out a way to do infinite scrolling with the new paradigma of SwiftUI
- Search for movies
